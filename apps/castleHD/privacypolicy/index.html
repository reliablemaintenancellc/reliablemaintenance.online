            <h3>Personalized vs. Non-Personalized Ads</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> These ads are tailored to your interests based on your 
                    activity, demographics, or other signals collected by advertising networks. Personalized ads 
                    are served only where you have provided consent or where permitted by law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Non-Personalized Ads:</strong> These ads are not based on your past behavior or interests. 
                    They may still use contextual information (such as general location or the content you are viewing) 
                    but do not rely on personal data profiles.
                </li>
